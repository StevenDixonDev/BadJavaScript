# :japanese_goblin: IJScript

IJS is an attempt to write the most unreadable javascript. I have spent hours looking over code golf answers and playing with javascript coercion to create a guide on writing this *style* of code. 

This entire repo was inspired by code golf. If you don't know what code golf is check out this link [code golf](https://dev.to/healeycodes/answered-what-the-heck-is-code-golf-48pi). 

What does the **I** stand for in IJS?

Incomprehensible, indecipherable or inconceivable.

## :dart: Goal

Create a system of writing the most unreadable code possible. Random Coding challenges will be used as examples to show of the progression of the system. If you cannot follow along or are having trouble reading the code check out the [Tips page](Tips.md) or the the [Process page](Process.md) to find out how to write the code.

## Methodology

- [x] All answers should be as short and unreadable as possible.
  - Even if an answer would be shorter the more unreadable answer should be used.
- [x] All answers must be resolved in a single concise arrow function
- [x] Minifiers should never be used.
- [x] Math is your best friend at the end of the day

One of the core principles of programming is writing readable code. IJS throws that to the wind and asks "What if we just wrote code that no one could read?" 

## Challenges

Check out the [Creations Page](Creations.md) for some challenges.

## :tada:	Conclusion

JavaScript is a very quirky language and can be written several different ways. Not all these ways are good, but the thing to keep in mind is that readable code is always better than non-readable code. Can you use some of the stuff from above to write your code? certainly! but good luck understanding it after a week. Code like this belongs to the realm of minifiers and it should stay like that. If you have read this far I suggest forgetting everything you have read and actually pick up a widely supported style guide and study that. Is JavaScript a bad Language? I don't think so, I think it is only as bad as you make it.

Why did you create this *"thing"*?

I really liked the Idea of code golfing but quickly realized that it in itself is a game and has almost no place inside of a proper workplace. I also love those 60's scifi horror movies where the evil thing is just something taken to the extreme in an impossible situation.
So this is my version of code golfing taken to an extreme. I also really like JavaScript and all the quirks that the language contains, this was a great learning experience.
